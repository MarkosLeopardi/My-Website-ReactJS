                <p>I was born in August 1997 in Kalamaria, Thessaloniki. I am a student at the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics at Sindos, Thessaloniki. <br/>
                    I have a degree in English (Proficiency) and Italian (Celi 3 - equivalent to Lower) as my father is Italian. In my free time, I play video games and row. <br/>
                    At times, I have worked in the catering industry and in the warehouse of a gift shop. Since I was young, I have been involved in gaming, which led me to 
                    pursue computer science and gaming design. <br/>I have volunteered at similar events (Egaming at the Thessaloniki International Fair - Gameathlon). 
                    Finally, I enjoy traveling, which is the reason I have visited several places (e.g., USA, Japan, etc.).
